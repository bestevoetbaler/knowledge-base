# Personal Perceptions vs Proximity Food Environments

> **Statement**: Personal perceptions might be stronger determinants of food acquisition, diets and health than proximity, particularly among those with personal modes of motorised transport (Turner et al., 2018:98).

## Key Evidence

Turner et al. (2018:98) synthesize understudied personal factors:

- **Aggarwal et al. (2014b)**: Prioritizing nutrition strongly associated with higher diet quality across all socioeconomic strata
- **Aggarwal et al. (2016)**: US national data underscores importance of positive food-related attitudes on diet quality

## Authors' Conclusion

'Personal perceptions might be stronger determinants of food acquisition, diets and health, than proximity, particularly among those with personal modes of motorised transport'

## Emerging Tools

- Ahmed and Byker Shanks (2017)
- Ahmed et al. (2018)
  - Assess fruit/vegetable desirability via sensory attributes

## Intervention Implications

Highlights need to address both:
1. External structural factors (availability, proximity)
2. Personal domain dimensions (attitudes, desirability, perceptions)
