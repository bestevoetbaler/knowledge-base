# External Domain Food Environment

> **Statement**: The External Domain Food Environment is 'the world of opportunities and constraints that are out there within a given context' (Turner et al., 2018:95), encompassing four structural dimensions that exist independently of individual characteristics.

## Four Dimensions

1. **Availability** - presence/absence of food source or product
2. **Prices** - cost of food products
3. **Vendor and product properties** - vendor types, hours, services; food quality, safety, processing, shelf-life, packaging
4. **Marketing and regulation** - promotional information, branding, advertising, sponsorship, labelling, policy regulations

## Framework Context

Part of two-domain socio-ecological framework distinguishing **structural factors** (External Domain) from **individual-level dimensions** (Personal Domain).

## Critical Relationship

Distinguished from Personal Domain which captures accessibility, affordability, convenience, desirability relative to individuals.
