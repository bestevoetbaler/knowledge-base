# Systematic Review Evidence: Neighborhood Food Availability and Diet in LMICs

> **Statement**: Neighborhood food availability shows consistent associations with dietary behavior in urban LMIC settings, with higher supermarket density associated with healthier diets and higher fast food density associated with less healthy diets.

## Evidence Synthesis

Westbury et al. (2021) synthesized evidence from 14 studies examining neighborhood food availability and dietary outcomes in urban LMICs. **10 of these studies (all good or moderate quality) found positive associations** between food availability measures and dietary behavior (p. 5).

**Key patterns across studies**:

1. **Supermarket availability → healthier diets**
   - 3 studies (Brazil, Mexico) found higher supermarket density associated with higher fruit/vegetable consumption
   - Effect consistent across different LMIC contexts (p. 5)

2. **Fast food/convenience store availability → less healthy diets**
   - 3 studies found greater density of fast food outlets and convenience stores associated with higher consumption of processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages
   - Dose-response relationship suggested in some studies (p. 5-6)

3. **Fruit/vegetable vendor availability → higher consumption**
   - 4 studies found availability of fruit/vegetable vendors associated with higher consumption of these foods
   - Important for informal food sector in LMICs (p. 5)

## Strength of Evidence

**Quality assessment**: 10 of 14 studies rated as good or moderate quality using adapted QATQS tool (p. 5)

**Consistency**: Direction of associations consistent across geographic regions (Africa, Latin America, Asia) despite different measures and outcomes

**Study designs**: All cross-sectional, limiting causal inference but providing consistent correlational evidence

## Context-Specific Considerations

**LMIC food environment features**:
- Mix of formal (supermarkets) and informal (street vendors, wet markets) food sources
- Rapid nutrition transition creating changing availability landscape
- Geographic variation in vendor types and density across regions (p. 1-2)

**Contrast with HIC evidence**: Patterns similar to high-income countries, but LMIC contexts include greater role of informal food sector that is understudied (p. 12)

## Implications for Research and Practice

**Research directions**:
- Need for longitudinal studies to establish causality
- Need to examine interactions between formal and informal food sources
- Validated measurement tools for LMIC food availability assessment (p. 13)

**Intervention implications**:
- Urban planning and zoning policies could target food outlet density
- Interventions should address both formal and informal food sectors
- Context-specific adaptation needed (not direct translation from HIC interventions) (p. 13-14)

## Critical Relationships

- Builds on [[External Domain Food Environment]] concept from Turner et al. 2018
- Provides empirical evidence for theoretical availability-diet pathways
- Complements [[Personal Domain Food Environment]] accessibility findings
- Relevant for [[Nutrition transition]] dynamics in urban LMICs
