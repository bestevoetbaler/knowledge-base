# HIC-LMIC Disparities in Food Environment Research Evidence

> **Statement**: Food environment research is heavily concentrated in high-income countries (HICs), despite LMICs facing more rapid food system changes and bearing greater burden of malnutrition, creating critical evidence gaps for contexts where interventions are most needed.

## Evidence Disparity Magnitude

Westbury et al. (2021) highlight the **stark imbalance** between HIC and LMIC food environment research (p. 1-2):

**HIC research landscape**:
- Extensive evidence base spanning decades
- Comprehensive coverage of all food environment domains
- Multiple validated measurement tools
- Robust experimental and longitudinal evidence
- Well-developed theoretical frameworks (p. 1-2)

**LMIC research landscape** (from systematic review):
- Only 74 studies identified across 29 LMIC countries
- 66 of 74 studies (89%) cross-sectional only
- Major domains completely unstudied (e.g., regulation)
- Several personal domain dimensions with <5 studies each
- Limited validated measurement tools for LMIC contexts (p. 4, 9-12)

## Geographic Patterns Within LMICs

**Uneven distribution** of the limited LMIC research (p. 4):

**Regional coverage**:
- Latin America/Caribbean: 29 studies (39%)
- Asia: 23 studies (31%)
- Africa: 21 studies (28%)
- Multiple regions: 1 study (1%)

**Major gaps identified**:
- South Asia severely underrepresented despite massive populations (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh)
- Limited representation of conflict-affected and fragile states
- Megacity vs. smaller urban area disparities
- Within-country geographic variation not well-studied (p. 12)

## Why Disparities Matter

**LMIC contexts differ fundamentally** from HICs in ways that affect food environments (p. 1-2, 12):

1. **Informal food sector dominance**:
   - Street vendors, wet markets, informal vendors
   - Not well-captured by HIC-developed frameworks or measures

2. **Rapid nutrition transition**:
   - Faster pace of change than historical HIC transitions
   - Simultaneous undernutrition and obesity (double burden)
   - Globalization and economic development driving changes

3. **Different regulatory contexts**:
   - Limited governance capacity
   - Weak enforcement of existing regulations
   - Different political economy of food systems

4. **Distinct socioeconomic contexts**:
   - Greater income inequality
   - Different transportation infrastructure
   - Different household food acquisition patterns

5. **Cultural and dietary differences**:
   - Different traditional food cultures
   - Different meanings of "healthy" food
   - Different social contexts of eating

## Consequences of Evidence Gaps

**For policy and practice** (p. 13-14):
- LMIC policymakers lack context-specific evidence to guide interventions
- Risk of inappropriate translation of HIC interventions to LMIC contexts
- Missed opportunities for LMIC-specific intervention innovations
- Resource allocation decisions not evidence-based

**For theory development** (p. 12):
- Food environment frameworks based primarily on HIC contexts
- May not fully capture LMIC food environment complexities
- Limited understanding of mechanisms in different contexts
- Understudied dimensions may be more important in LMICs than HICs (e.g., affordability)

**For health equity**:
- Evidence gap where need is greatest
- Risk of widening health inequities without context-appropriate interventions
- Limited voice for LMIC perspectives in global food environment discourse

## Drivers of Research Disparities

**Resource constraints** (implied, p. 12-13):
- Limited research funding in LMICs
- Fewer trained researchers in food environment methods
- Data infrastructure gaps (GIS, retail databases)
- Competing research priorities (infectious diseases, basic nutrition)

**Methodological barriers**:
- HIC measurement tools not validated for LMIC contexts
- Informal food sector harder to measure than formal retailers
- Complex food environment requiring multi-method approaches
- Limited availability of secondary data sources

**Publication and research system factors**:
- Language barriers (this review limited to 4 languages)
- Publication bias toward HIC journals
- Limited international collaboration networks
- Research paradigms shaped by HIC contexts

## Implications for Future Research

**Strategic priorities** (p. 13):

1. **Capacity building**:
   - Train LMIC researchers in food environment methods
   - Develop LMIC research networks and collaborations
   - Invest in LMIC food environment research infrastructure

2. **Methodology development**:
   - Validate existing measures in LMIC contexts
   - Develop new LMIC-appropriate measurement tools
   - Mixed methods to understand context-specific mechanisms
   - Adapt methods for informal food sector assessment

3. **Fill critical evidence gaps**:
   - Prioritize understudied domains (regulation, personal domain dimensions)
   - Prioritize underrepresented regions (South Asia, Africa)
   - Longitudinal and experimental designs where feasible
   - Multi-country comparative studies

4. **Theory development**:
   - LMIC-grounded conceptual framework development
   - Test applicability of HIC frameworks in LMIC contexts
   - Identify LMIC-specific food environment dimensions
   - Develop context-sensitive theories of change

## Moving Toward Equity

**Required shifts** (p. 13-14):

1. **Research funding**: Increase investment in LMIC food environment research
2. **Partnerships**: Equitable North-South and South-South collaborations
3. **Voice**: Center LMIC researcher and community perspectives
4. **Innovation**: Support LMIC-led methodological and theoretical innovations
5. **Application**: Rapid translation of evidence to policy and practice in LMICs

**Goal**: Build LMIC evidence base sufficient to inform context-appropriate interventions addressing malnutrition in all its forms (undernutrition, overweight/obesity, micronutrient deficiencies) (p. 14)

## Critical Relationships

- Highlights global inequities in food environment research
- Calls into question generalizability of [[External Domain Food Environment]] and [[Personal Domain Food Environment]] frameworks developed primarily in HICs
- Emphasizes need for context-specific evidence for [[Nutrition transition]] interventions
- Connects to broader global health equity and research justice issues
- Explains why [[Evidence Gaps Personal Domain LMIC]] exist - LMIC research severely limited
- Context for all findings in [[Systematic Review Evidence Availability Diet LMIC]] and [[Food Accessibility Strongest Evidence LMIC]]
- Exacerbated by [[Cross-Sectional Design Limitations Food Environment]] - LMICs have even fewer longitudinal studies
- Relevant to [[School Food Environment Diet Evidence LMIC]] - schools have most LMIC evidence but still limited
- Related to [[Availability Precedes Accessibility Principle]] testing in different contexts
- Shows need for LMIC-validated measures discussed in [[Westbury2021]]
- Connected to [[Turner2018]] framework applicability questions
- Affects interpretation of [[Personal Perceptions vs Proximity Food Environment]] in different contexts
