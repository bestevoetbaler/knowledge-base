# Evidence Gaps in Personal Domain Food Environment Dimensions in LMICs

> **Statement**: Personal domain dimensions of convenience, desirability, and affordability are severely understudied in LMIC food environment research, with insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about their influences on diet and health.

## Evidence Gap Magnitude

Westbury et al.'s (2021) systematic review revealed **stark evidence gaps** for three of Turner et al.'s (2018) four personal domain dimensions (p. 9):

**Affordability**:
- Only 6 studies examined affordability-diet/health associations
- 4 studies showed associations, but insufficient for strong conclusions
- Limited geographic representation (primarily China) (p. 8-9)

**Convenience**:
- Only 2 studies examined convenience
- Insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions (p. 9)

**Desirability**:
- Only 1 study examined desirability (food preferences)
- Insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions (p. 9)

**Contrast with accessibility**: While accessibility had robust evidence (10 of 11 studies showing associations), other personal domain dimensions severely neglected (p. 8-9)

## Theoretical Implications

**Incomplete personal domain understanding**: Turner et al.'s (2018) framework identifies four personal domain dimensions:
1. **Accessibility** - well-studied ✓
2. **Affordability** - understudied
3. **Convenience** - severely understudied
4. **Desirability** - severely understudied (p. 2, 9)

**Question for theory**: Are convenience, affordability, and desirability less important in LMIC contexts, or simply unstudied? (p. 12)

**Potential mechanisms being missed**:
- Economic constraints (affordability) may be more important in LMICs than HICs
- Time constraints (convenience) may operate differently with different labor patterns
- Cultural food preferences (desirability) may mediate availability/accessibility effects (p. 12)

## Why These Gaps Matter for LMICs

**Affordability particularly critical in LMIC contexts**:
- Higher proportion of income spent on food
- Greater price sensitivity for food purchasing decisions
- Informal credit systems and food sharing practices
- Price volatility affecting food access (p. 1, 8-9)

**Convenience may operate differently**:
- Different time use patterns (agricultural seasons, informal work)
- Food preparation practices (time-intensive cooking vs. convenience foods)
- Gendered divisions of labor affecting food acquisition time
- Street food as convenience option (understudied) (p. 9, 12)

**Desirability shaped by cultural context**:
- Rapid nutrition transition changing food preferences
- Globalization affecting desirability of Western foods
- Traditional food cultures influencing choices
- Social status meanings of different foods (p. 1, 9)

## Methodological Challenges

**Why these dimensions understudied** (p. 12):

1. **Measurement difficulty**:
   - Affordability requires household economic data + food prices
   - Convenience difficult to operationalize objectively
   - Desirability involves subjective preferences and cultural values

2. **Data availability**:
   - Price data less accessible in informal food markets
   - Household economic data sensitive/difficult to collect
   - Preference data requires individual-level surveys

3. **Conceptual clarity**:
   - Overlap between dimensions (e.g., convenience and accessibility)
   - "Prices" (external domain) vs. "affordability" (personal domain) difficult to separate

## Contrast with HIC Research

**In HIC contexts**, these dimensions have been studied more extensively:
- Store choice research examines convenience
- Price elasticity studies examine affordability
- Consumer preference research examines desirability (p. 12)

**LMIC research lags behind**, potentially because:
- Research paradigm imported from HICs focused on availability/accessibility
- Measurement tools not validated for LMIC contexts
- Resource constraints limiting complex data collection (p. 12-13)

## Implications for Future Research

**Urgent priorities** (p. 13):

1. **Develop LMIC-appropriate measures**:
   - Affordability measures accounting for informal economies
   - Convenience measures considering LMIC time use patterns
   - Desirability measures capturing cultural food preferences

2. **Mixed methods approaches**:
   - Qualitative research to understand how these dimensions operate
   - Quantitative validation of constructs
   - Integration of objective and subjective measures

3. **Comprehensive multi-domain studies**:
   - Examine all personal domain dimensions simultaneously
   - Test relative importance across domains
   - Examine interactions (e.g., affordability × convenience)

4. **Context-specific theory development**:
   - Do LMIC food environments require modified conceptual frameworks?
   - How do personal domain dimensions interact with rapid nutrition transition?
   - What LMIC-specific dimensions might be missing from existing frameworks?

## Research Design Recommendations

**For affordability studies** (p. 13):
- Collect matched food price and household income data
- Examine price promotions and subsidies
- Study informal credit/food sharing mechanisms
- Use natural experiments (price changes, subsidy programs)

**For convenience studies** (p. 13):
- Time use surveys linked to food environment measures
- Examine convenience of different vendor types (formal vs. informal)
- Study prepared food availability (street food, take-away)
- Consider gendered dimensions of convenience

**For desirability studies** (p. 13):
- Cultural food preference surveys
- Examine marketing/advertising influences
- Study taste perceptions of healthy vs. unhealthy foods
- Longitudinal studies of preference changes during nutrition transition

## Critical Relationships

- Identifies major gap in [[Personal Domain Food Environment]] research
- Contrasts with robust evidence for accessibility dimension
- Questions completeness of Turner et al. (2018) framework for LMICs
- Highlights need for LMIC-specific food environment theory development
