Four Food Source Typology LMICs - Turner et al (2018:95 Fig 1) expand food environment beyond market-only focus, critical for LMICs: (A) Market-based sources - formal (supermarkets, chains) and informal (street vendors, wet markets), (B) Own production - urban, peri-urban, rural agriculture, (C) Wild harvested foods, (D) Food transfers including gifts, plus (E) shaped by individual daily mobility. Authors state 'The inclusion of both market and non-market-based food sources is an important distinction from existing conceptualizations'. Non-market sources especially important in traditional LMIC food environments characterized by limited availability/accessibility where many acquire food from own-production plus in-kind transfers/gifts (HLPE 2017). Urban agriculture also relevant (FAO 2014). Payment in food rather than cash commonplace in many settings
