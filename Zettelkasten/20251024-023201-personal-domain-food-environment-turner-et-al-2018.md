# Personal Domain Food Environment

> **Statement**: The Personal Domain Food Environment encompasses individual-level dimensions relative to persons that mediate how structural food availability translates into actual food acquisition.

## Four Dimensions

1. **Accessibility** - distance, time, space, place, daily mobility, transport modes shaping activity spaces
2. **Affordability** - interaction of prices with individual purchasing power
3. **Convenience** - vendor/product properties interacting with individual time allocation and preparation facilities
4. **Desirability** - marketing/regulation interacting with individual preferences, acceptability, tastes, desires, attitudes, culture, knowledge, skills

## Framework Context

Part of two-domain socio-ecological framework. Continuous complex interactions with External Domain shape food acquisition.

## Research Gap Addressed

Addresses repeated calls to allocate greater attention to individual-level aspects (Black et al., 2014; FAO, 2016a; Lytle, 2009).
