# School Food Environments and Dietary Behavior in Urban LMICs

> **Statement**: School food availability demonstrates strong consistent associations with children's dietary behavior in urban LMIC settings, with food available at schools positively associated with its consumption by students.

## Evidence Synthesis

Westbury et al. (2021) identified **20 studies examining school food environments** in urban LMICs - the largest evidence base for any specific setting in their systematic review (p. 6-7).

**Evidence for dietary behavior**:
- 9 studies examined school food availability → dietary behavior
- **8 of 9 studies found positive associations** between school food availability and consumption
- Consistent across different types of foods (healthy and unhealthy) (p. 6-7)

**Evidence for nutrition/health outcomes**:
- 11 studies examined school food availability → BMI/obesity
- 6 of 11 studies found associations
- More mixed evidence than for dietary behavior (p. 7)

## Key Findings

**Direction of associations**:

1. **Healthy food availability → consumption**
   - Schools with fruit/vegetable availability had higher student consumption of these foods (4 studies)
   - School meal programs associated with higher nutrient intake (3 studies) (p. 6-7)

2. **Unhealthy food availability → consumption**
   - Vending machines with snacks/sugar-sweetened beverages associated with higher consumption (3 studies)
   - School canteens selling processed foods associated with less healthy dietary patterns (2 studies) (p. 7)

3. **Pathway to health outcomes unclear**
   - Mixed evidence for BMI/obesity outcomes suggests:
     - Dietary changes may not translate directly to weight outcomes
     - Need for longer follow-up periods
     - Other factors (physical activity, home environment) may moderate effects (p. 7)

## LMIC School Food Environment Context

**Unique features** of LMIC school settings (p. 6-7):
- Mix of formal school feeding programs and informal vendors
- Street food vendors often located near schools
- Limited regulation of foods sold in/around schools
- Varying levels of nutrition education
- Schools may be primary food source during day for low-income children

**Geographic variation**:
- Latin America: More studies on school feeding programs
- Africa: More studies on vendor availability around schools
- Asia: Mixed focus on canteens and external vendors (p. 4, 6-7)

## Methodological Considerations

**Measurement approaches**:
- Objective audits of school food availability (most common)
- Student/parent surveys of perceived availability
- Administrative data on school meal programs
- Observation of vendor density near schools (p. 6-7)

**Study design limitations**:
- 18 of 20 studies were cross-sectional
- Limited experimental evidence
- Few studies examined both in-school and peri-school food environments together (p. 7, 10)

## Theoretical Significance

**Availability as primary mechanism**: In school settings, **availability appears to be the dominant pathway** influencing children's dietary behavior (p. 7).

This aligns with Turner et al. (2018)'s external domain emphasis on availability, but raises questions about personal domain dimensions:
- Limited choice/autonomy in schools vs. neighborhoods
- Accessibility less relevant (captive audience)
- Affordability important but understudied (only 2 school studies examined prices) (p. 7-9)

**Critical developmental period**: Schools represent key setting for shaping dietary habits during childhood/adolescence, when preferences and patterns develop (p. 6)

## Evidence Quality

**Strengths**:
- Largest evidence base of any specific setting
- Consistent direction of associations
- Good representation across LMIC regions (p. 6-7)

**Limitations**:
- Predominantly cross-sectional designs
- Short-term dietary outcomes (not long-term health)
- Limited assessment of intervention effectiveness
- Confounding by school-level SES not always addressed (p. 7, 10-11)

## Implications

**For research**:
- Experimental studies needed (school food policy interventions)
- Examine both in-school and peri-school (vendor) environments together
- Longer follow-up to assess health outcomes
- Study mechanisms: How does school food availability translate to consumption? (p. 13)

**For interventions**:
- **High-impact setting**: Schools offer concentrated intervention opportunity
- Availability interventions show promise (increasing healthy options, restricting unhealthy)
- Need for comprehensive approach: in-school + peri-school regulation
- Nutrition education may enhance availability interventions but insufficient alone (p. 13-14)

**For policy**:
- School food standards and regulations justified by evidence
- Zoning restrictions on vendors near schools could be effective
- School feeding programs can improve dietary quality
- Need for monitoring and enforcement mechanisms (p. 14)

## Critical Relationships

- Demonstrates [[External Domain Food Environment]] availability dimension in specific setting
- Complements neighborhood food environment research
- Relevant for [[Nutrition transition]] as schools become sites of unhealthy food exposure
- Connects to broader child health and obesity prevention strategies
