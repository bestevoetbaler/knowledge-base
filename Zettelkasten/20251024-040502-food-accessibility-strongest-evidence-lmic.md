# Food Accessibility Shows Strongest Evidence for Diet Associations in LMICs

> **Statement**: Accessibility (proximity and travel time to food sources) demonstrates the strongest and most consistent evidence of all food environment domains for associations with dietary behavior in urban LMIC settings, with 10 of 11 studies showing positive associations.

## Evidence Synthesis

Westbury et al. (2021) found that **accessibility had the most consistent evidence** across all food environment domains examined in their systematic review of urban LMIC settings (p. 8).

**Evidence strength**: 11 studies examined accessibility-diet associations:
- **10 studies found positive associations** (all rated good or moderate quality)
- Only 1 study found null association
- Strongest consistency of any domain reviewed (p. 8)

## Key Findings Across Studies

**Distance to healthy food sources**:
- Shorter distance to supermarkets associated with:
  - Higher fruit/vegetable consumption (4 studies)
  - More diverse diets (2 studies)
  - Lower consumption of processed foods (2 studies) (p. 8)

**Distance to unhealthy food sources**:
- Shorter distance to fast food outlets associated with:
  - Higher consumption of fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages (3 studies)
  - Higher energy-dense food intake (2 studies) (p. 8)

**Travel time matters**:
- Studies measuring travel time (not just distance) found even stronger associations
- Particularly important in LMIC contexts where transportation access varies significantly (p. 8)

## Theoretical Significance

**Personal domain primacy**: These findings suggest that the **personal domain dimension of accessibility may be more proximal** to dietary behavior than external domain measures of availability in LMIC contexts (p. 8).

**Mechanism**: Accessibility operates through:
- Physical proximity reducing barriers to obtaining food
- Time costs of food acquisition
- Integration with daily activity patterns and routines (p. 8)

**Contrast with availability**: While availability measures "what exists" in the food environment, accessibility measures "what is reachable" - a more individually-relevant construct (linking to Turner et al. 2018's external/personal domain distinction) (p. 2, 8)

## LMIC-Specific Context

**Why accessibility matters more in LMICs**:
- Limited private vehicle ownership → walking distance critical
- Public transportation may be unreliable or expensive
- Time poverty (long working hours) → proximity becomes essential
- Informal food sector often neighborhood-based (wet markets, street vendors)
- Infrastructure challenges (roads, safety) affect travel time beyond distance (p. 1, 8)

**Geographic heterogeneity**: Accessibility effects may vary by:
- Urban density (megacities vs. smaller urban areas)
- Transportation infrastructure quality
- Income levels (affecting transportation options)
- Neighborhood safety (p. 8, 12)

## Methodological Considerations

**Measurement approaches** across studies (p. 8):
- Euclidean distance (straight-line)
- Network distance (street routes)
- Travel time estimates
- Perceived accessibility (self-reported proximity)

**Scale matters**: Studies used varied buffer sizes (250m to 2km) and catchment area definitions, affecting comparability (p. 10-11)

## Implications

**For research**:
- Accessibility should be prioritized in LMIC food environment studies
- Need for validated accessibility measures in LMIC contexts
- Examine accessibility alongside availability to understand relative influence
- Study transportation access as moderator of accessibility effects (p. 13)

**For interventions**:
- Urban planning should prioritize proximity of healthy food sources
- Transportation interventions may modify food accessibility
- Neighborhood-level interventions more promising than individual-level for accessibility
- Mobile vendors and markets could improve accessibility in underserved areas (p. 13-14)

**For theory**:
- Supports Turner et al. (2018) personal domain importance
- Suggests accessibility may mediate availability effects
- Highlights need for LMIC-specific food environment models that account for transportation and infrastructure constraints (p. 12)

## Critical Relationships

- Strongest empirical support for [[Personal Domain Food Environment]] dimensions
- Complements but differs from [[External Domain Food Environment]] availability measures
- Relates to [[Availability Precedes Accessibility Principle]] but shows accessibility may be more proximal predictor of behavior
- Relevant for understanding [[Nutrition transition]] interventions in urban LMICs
