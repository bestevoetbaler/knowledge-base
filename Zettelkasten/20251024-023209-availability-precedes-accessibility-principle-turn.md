# Availability Precedes Accessibility Principle

> **Statement**: 'A food cannot be accessible to an individual if it is not available' - availability always precedes accessibility temporally and logically (Turner et al., 2018:Table 1).

## Conceptual Distinction

Turner et al. (2018) clarify critical distinction often conflated in literature (Charreire et al., 2010; Caspi et al., 2012):

- **Availability** (external domain): presence/absence of food source or product within a given context
- **Accessibility** (personal domain): relative to individuals concerning distance, time, space, place, daily mobility, transport modes shaping activity spaces

## Measurement Implications

This distinction is essential for:
- Proper food environment measurement
- Intervention design in both HICs and LMICs
- Avoiding conceptual confusion in research

## Temporal and Logical Precedence

**Temporal**: Food must first exist in environment before individual can access it
**Logical**: Structural availability is prerequisite for personal accessibility
