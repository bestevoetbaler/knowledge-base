Food Environment as Interface Concept - Turner et al (2018:95) building on FAO (2016a:21) conceptualize food environment as 'the interface that mediates people's food acquisition and consumption within the wider food system' (official definition p95). Interface positioned between food system ('farm to flush' UN System Standing Committee on Nutrition 2016) and dietary outcomes. Fig 1 depicts interface where people interact to acquire foods from four source types (market-based, own production, wild harvested, transfers/gifts) shaped by individual daily mobility. Interface concept helps 'ground the food environment construct in relation to people's daily lives and activities that shape their diets' and 'distinguish between these related concepts' of food systems vs food environments. Macro-level political, economic, socio-cultural factors influence both interface and wider food system (Baker et al 2018, Swinburn et al 2013)
