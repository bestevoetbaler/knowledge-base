HIC vs LMIC External Food Environment Differences - Turner et al (2018:98-99 Table 2) systematize fundamental differences despite global homogenization trends. AVAILABILITY: HIC formal markets relatively stable with little seasonal variation vs LMIC highly dynamic informal markets (street vendors, mobile traders) with high seasonal variation in perishables, plus own-production vulnerable to shocks. PRICES: HIC relatively stable vs LMIC highly volatile, though ready-to-eat street foods relatively cheap while perishables expensive/volatile. VENDOR PROPERTIES: HIC brick-and-mortar, 24/7 trading, high packaging, cold storage, safety regulations vs LMIC temporary stalls, limited hours, limited packaging, gaps in cold chain, limited regulations, but potential for credit. MARKETING: HIC highly regulated, high promotion/labelling vs LMIC largely unregulated, basic labelling. Methods designed for stable HIC environments need development and adaptation for LMIC contexts capturing diurnal and seasonal cycles
